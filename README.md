# 🎵 Music Sentiment Impact on Stock Returns Analysis [Advanced Data Mining]

## 📋 Overview
An advanced data mining project investigating the relationship between music sentiment and stock market returns (S&P 500 and Russell 3000) during 2017-2019, employing sophisticated statistical methods and machine learning techniques for causal inference.

## 💼 Business Impact
- Created a novel analytical framework for examining behavioral finance factors in stock market movements
- Developed robust statistical models that can process and analyze multi-dimensional financial data
- Provided actionable insights about the relationship between sentiment indicators and market returns
- Established a methodological foundation for future sentiment-based market analysis

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
### Technologies & Tools Used
- Python for statistical analysis and modeling
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- statsmodels for regression analysis
- scikit-learn for machine learning implementations
- Custom implementations of Double Machine Learning (DML)

### 📊 Key Features
1. Comprehensive Data Analysis
   - Weekly stock return calculations
   - Risk-adjusted returns computation
   - Stream-weighted average valence (SWAV) analysis

2. Advanced Statistical Methods
   - OLS Regression with robust error estimation
   - Bootstrapping analysis
   - Heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC0) standard errors
   - Lasso regression for model selection
   - Double Machine Learning for causal inference

3. Robustness Checks
   - Models with and without control variables
   - Multiple market indices analysis (S&P 500, Russell 3000)
   - Risk-adjusted return analysis
   - Lagged variable implementation

## 📈 Key Findings
- Identified non-significant relationship between music sentiment and stock returns
- Discovered potential mean-reversion effects in lagged returns
- Demonstrated robust statistical validation through multiple methodologies
- Provided contrasting results to existing literature, suggesting market efficiency

## 🔬 Methodological Innovations
